This is a continuation of our multi-part series on building a simple web application on [AWS]() using [AWS Lambda]() and the [ServerlessFramework](). You can review the first, second, and third parts of this series starting with the setup of your `local` environment at:

* [Part 1: How To SetUp Your `local` Serverless Environment](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToSetUpYourLocalServerlessEnvironment.md)

* [Part 2: How To Configure Your Serverless Backend API](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToConfigureYourServerlessBackend.md)

* [Part 3: How To Configure Your Infrastructure As Code, Mock Services, & Unit Testing](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToConfigure.IAC.Mocks.UnitTests.md)

You can also clone a sample of the application we will be using in this tutorial here: [Serverless-Starter-Service](https://github.com/lopezdp/ServerlessStarterService)

## Code Review Agility

We have definitely covered a lot of ground by now, and it may be best to take a minute and work through a *Code Review* of sorts, that we can use to absorb all of this information that we have reviewed and implemented together before merging our code and deploying our services into *production*. It is definitely a good idea to take this time to think about the workflow we will put in place to manage our day to day development and implementation activities as a team of engineers. [In my case it's just `Wilson` and I, remember](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToSetUpYourLocalServerlessEnvironment.md#setup-editor-and-install-linting)?
