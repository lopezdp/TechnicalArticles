This is a continuation of our multi-part series on building a simple web application on [AWS]() using [AWS Lambda]() and the [ServerlessFramework](). You can review the first, second, and third parts of this series starting with the setup of your `local` environment at:

* [Part 1: How To SetUp Your `local` Serverless Environment](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToSetUpYourLocalServerlessEnvironment.md)

* [Part 2: How To Configure Your Serverless Backend API](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToConfigureYourServerlessBackend.md)

* [Part 3: How To Configure Your Infrastructure As Code, Mock Services, & Unit Testing](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToConfigure.IAC.Mocks.UnitTests.md)

You can also clone a sample of the application we will be using in this tutorial here: [Serverless-Starter-Service](https://github.com/lopezdp/ServerlessStarterService)

## Code Review Agility

We have definitely covered a lot of ground by now, and it may be best to take a minute and work through a *Code Review* of sorts, that we can use to absorb all of this information that we have reviewed and implemented together before merging our code and deploying our services into *production*. It is definitely a good idea to take this time to think about the workflow we will put in place to manage our day to day development and implementation activities as a team of engineers. [In my case it's just `Wilson` and I, remember](https://github.com/lopezdp/TechnicalArticles/blob/master/HowToSetUpYourLocalServerlessEnvironment.md#setup-editor-and-install-linting)?

Collaborating with other team members can be tricky, that is, it can be tricky if you don't have a plan in place to work in an organized manner!!! We recommend that the documentation for any project repository include a set of `ContributionGuidelines.md` that dictate how each member of your team shall interact with the organization's source code. There are numerous examples out in the [ether](https://www.google.com) that you can look to as a set of guiding principles, and yet, you know I have a suggestion for you anyway. As someone who has published OpenSource work for NASA as a contractor, I suggest you model any `ContributionGuidelines` that you make for you and your team after the [NASA OpenMCT](https://github.com/nasa/openmct/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) project guildelines to start off. It is pretty straght forward and really gets to the point in terms of what a good OpenSource contribution policy should look like.

In an [Agile]() development environment, we just want a process that we can use to iterate over a predefined *Code Review* workflow that will help us implement and merge new updates to our source code efficiently, transparently, and with close to zero downtime in the *Wild*. When a team member writes and implements and set of features, there should be someone, again, in my case `Wilson`, who will review the code you have implemented on a `topic-branch` in [git]() after you create a [Pull Request]() for your project lead to review your code.
