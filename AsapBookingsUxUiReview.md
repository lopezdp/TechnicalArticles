# ASAPBookings.com UX/UI WebApp Testing & Review

**Reviewer:** David P. Lopez

**Web Application:** https://www.asapbookings.com

**UpWork ContractID:** 21709334

Client need for a QA/QC tester to test a new web application at the website above.

## On Page Load

1. When the page loads for the first time, it loads on the `Register` form, and the title is only underlined as shown in **Image 1** displayed in **Observation 1** below.

2. When the `Register` page is displayed on a mobile device with `screen size < 768px`, the margins can be improved to display a consistent "look and feel" between the header image, the title/tagline text, and the `Register` form itself as discussed in **Observation 2** below.

### Observation 1

When a user clicks on the `Login` tab and reverts back to the `Register` form, the fields are rendered with a light blue background highlight as shown in **Image 2** and **Image 3** below:

### Reviewer Suggestion

Highlight the `Register` tab on the initial page load of the application also to maintain the visual consistency of the different design elements.

### Observation 2

When the `Register` page is displayed on a mobile device, there is an obvious difference in the `margin` settings between the header image, the title/tagline text, and the `Register` form itself.

### Reviewer Suggestion

Correct `margin` inconsitencies and select a consistent margin setting for each UX element displayed to the device.
